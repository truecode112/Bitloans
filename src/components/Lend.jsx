                <p><strong>Overview of the Lending Process</strong></p>
                <p>
                    1. Account Creation:
                    Get started by creating an account on our platform. It's a simple and quick process.
                    <br></br>2. Deposit Bitcoin:
                    Once your account is created, you can deposit Bitcoin into your lending account. We provide you with a unique wallet address where you can securely transfer your Bitcoin.
                    <br></br>3. Choose Lending:
                    Within your account, select the lending option to start earning attractive returns on your deposited Bitcoin.
                    <br></br>4. Minimum Deposit Requirement:
                    Please note that there is a minimum deposit requirement of $5,000 to participate in the lending program. This ensures a sufficient pool of funds for lending opportunities.
                    <br></br>5. Lending Period and Interest:
                    As a lender, you have the flexibility to choose the lending period that suits your investment goals. The longer the lending period, the higher the potential returns. Our platform provides competitive interest rates based on loan categories and loan amounts.
                    <br></br>6. Lending Pool and Borrower Allocation:
                    Your deposited Bitcoin contributes to our lending pool, which is used to finance borrower loans. The allocation process ensures a balanced distribution of funds among qualified borrowers while mitigating risk.
                    <br></br>7. Returns and Payouts:
                    You can enjoy regular monthly interest payouts at 14% P.A on your lending account based on your invested amount. The interest earned is compounded with your lending balance, increasing your overall investment balance.
                    <br></br>8. Withdrawal and Reinvestment:
                    At any time during the lending period, you have the option to withdraw funds from your lending account, subject to daily withdrawal limits. To guard against money laundering, we allow only two withdrawals per day, and each withdrawal cannot exceed 33.3% of your total lending account balance. Please note that if you decide to withdraw funds from your lending account before the end of the first two months of investment, you will forfeit your interest. However, the interest accrued during this period will be available to you after two months.
